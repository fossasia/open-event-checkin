## Setup Guide for Kiosk Printing
In Chrome this is called  **"silent printing"**  or  **"kiosk printing"**.

### Steps

* **Step 0** - Create a Chrome shortcut to your desktop

* **Step 1** - Configure your desired printer settings by opening Chrome without ``--kiosk --kiosk-printing``

* **Step 2** - ``Ctrl + P`` or **Print** to pop up the Print Preview and update any settings like *paper size*, *color*, or more

 * **Step 3** - Press **Cancel** & **Close** Chrome to save the settings

#### For Debian-based Linux users (untested)
Make sure you have the prerequisite mentioned above installed before proceeding further.

* **Step 4** - Open **Terminal** and open Chrome with flags
	``
$ google-chrome --kiosk --kiosk-printing
``

* **Step 5** - Now, when you print, badge will be sent directly to the default printer.


#### For Windows users
Make sure you have the prerequisite mentioned above installed before proceeding further.

* **Step 4** - **Right click the shortcut**  and click  **"Properties"**.

* **Step 5** - In the  **"Target"**  field after  **"...chrome.exe"**, type this: ``--kiosk --kiosk-printing``
Note there is a space after ‚Äù, then two hyphens (something like this image):

* **Step 6** - Click  **Apply**. Now, when you use this shortcut to Chrome, badge will be sent directly to the default printer for printing.

*Note: To configure your printer again, following Step 4 - 6 but this time, remove the ``--kiosk --kiosk-printing``*
